# magpie
Magpie is my personal telegram bot.

## Structure
1. `magpie/` is the module containing all source files directly related to the bot.
2. `tests/` contains the unit tests for the module magpie. Generally, each file in magpie has a corresponding file in tests
3. `config.ini` contains application keys and the like.
4. `test` is a bash script which runs the contents of tests.
